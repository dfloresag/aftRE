aftRE
================

`aftRE` is a set of `R` tools for fitting Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) Models built on Template Model Builder (TMB), a novel tool for estimation of latent variable models relying on `CppAD` and `Eigen`. It is intended to handle traditional distributions used in survival analysis, such as Log-Normal, Log-Logistic and Weibull and others to be implemented in the future. At present it can account for right-censoring and Gaussian distributed Random effects.
